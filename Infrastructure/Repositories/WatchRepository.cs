// Summary: Repository class responsible for in-memory storage and management of
//          watch entities. Provides methods to add and retrieve watches for use
//          by higher-level services.
// <author> [Clive Leddy] </author>
// <created> [2025-05-23] </created>
// Notes: Implements IWatchRepository for dependency injection. Maintains a
//        preloaded in-memory list of sample watches. No longer exposes or manages
//        service-level business logic or singleton access; focuses solely on data
//        persistence and retrieval.
